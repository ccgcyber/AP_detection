/* $Version: $1.0.11$ */
wdetect is a signature-based, access-point detection tool for
finding devices on the *wired* network.  This includes, currently:

* An SNMP signature-based detection module

* An FTP signature-based port banner detection module

* An HTTP signature-based port banner detection module

* A Telnet signature-based port banner detection module

* A generic SNMP/FTP/HTTP/Telnet heuristic banner filter 

* A module that checks for known default UserID/Password pairs
  for access points

Signatures are updated at least once a month, while a company
is under a valid support contract.


**** CONFIGURATION AND USAGE ******

This is a really simple program

1) edit wdetect.conf and add your network
	Example, 
		network : 10.10.8.1-10.10.15.255
		network : 192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255

There's no limit on how many networks you can add.  

***NOTE*** : DO *not* add more than one class B (or /16)
	     network per 'network' declaration.  If you have
	     multiple class B networks, use separate entries
	     for each line.


2) *Optional* - edit start.pl and increase or decrease your 
   thread count.  NOTE: threads cannot exceed 255.  I recommend 64 

   NOTE : 64 threads is, in my opinion, optimal.  Against a firewalled
	  host, the check will take between 6 and 7 seconds (max).  This 
	  means that you will blow through a fully firewalled Class C
	  in less than 28 seconds.  

3) To generate a plaintext report, run
	./start.pl > report.txt

   To generate an html report, run
	./start.pl html > report.html



That's it.  Enjoy the program.  As new wireless signatures are released
we will send a modified binary.
